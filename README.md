# Usage

Really, I just created these functions because I became very tired of
trying to hand-decode Apple's CoreAudio
[AudioStreamBasicDefinition](http://google.com/search?q=Apple+Developer+AudioStreamBasicDescription)
structures. Also, when using [CAShow](http://google.com/search?q=Apple+Developer+Audio+Toolbox+Debugging+Reference+CAShow)
I became even more weary of tring to remember all of the various
`OSType` [FourCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FourCC) codes that CoreAudio uses.

I sincerely hope that using these functions makes your day just a little bit nicer.
